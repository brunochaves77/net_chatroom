Important Notes
When executing the page for two or more users, you need to open the browser as incognito mode, because the token session is stored on local storage of your browser.
If for any reason you receive error sending message to RabbitMQ, it is because the port couldnt be opened or is in use. 

Run SQLServer(port 1435) and RabbitMQ (port 15673).
Open the command prompt (cmd), navigate inside the project "\src" folder, and type: "run.bat"
This script will run the projects and open the browsers.
